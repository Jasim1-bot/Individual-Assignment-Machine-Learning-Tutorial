## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my full submission for the Individual Machine Learning Tutorial assignment.  
My selected topic is:

### **“Support Vector Machines With Kernels: Linear, Polynomial, and RBF Methods Demonstrated Using the make_moons Dataset.”**

The goal of the tutorial is to **teach** how kernel choice affects model behaviour, decision boundaries, and performance in classification tasks.

This repository includes:
- A formal academic-style PDF tutorial  
- A reproducible Jupyter Notebook  
- All generated figures  
- License and dependencies file

## 🎯 Summary of the Tutorial

The tutorial demonstrates:

### ✔️ Support Vector Machines  
Margin-based supervised learning classifiers.

### ✔️ Kernel Trick  
Kernels allow SVMs to model **non-linear boundaries** using the **kernel trick**.

### ✔️ Kernels Used  
- Linear  
- Polynomial (degree = 3)  
- Radial Basis Function (RBF)  

### ✔️ Dataset  
`make_moons` with 500 samples, noise = 0.25.

### ✔️ Outputs  
- Decision boundary visualisations  
- Confusion matrices  
- Accuracy comparison  
- Ethical considerations of ML models

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook svm_kernels.ipynb
```

Then run all cells from top to bottom.
